# About ExpertDesk Plus #
ExpertDesk Plus (edplus) is a Java library that simplifies AR System Java API development, licenced under the Apache License.
It acts as an add-on to the existing AR System API, not as a replacement. The features of the library are:

  * Uses Java 5 generics and the collection framework, eg Iterators
  * A single entry point, the Server class for common tasks
  * Can be 'plugged in' to existing code without major refactoring

This library is a refactoring of existing, production quality code, written by Mansystems.
Here are some [examples](Examples.md) of how to use the library.

_If you have downloaded edplus before april 4th, you might notice that the included jar also includes classes in the com.expertdesk.arplus package. This is fixed in the current distribution_
